AE2 code for Mobile Development and 3D Graphics

Developed using emulators, I did not test it on a real phone. I used 
Pixel 4 API 33 emulator - Android 13.0 ("Tiramisu") when developing on a MacOS laptop, 
and then Pixel 8 API 33 emulator - Android 13.0 ("Tiramisu") when developing on a Windows computer.
